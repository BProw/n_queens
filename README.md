"The n-queens puzzle is a well known problem created by Max Bezzel, a German chess player, in 1848.  To solve the puzzle one has to place n chess queens on an n√ón chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.  In this assignment you are asked to write a Haskell program to find (at least) one solution to the puzzle."
